        Grandma got run over by a reindeer, walking home from our house Christmas Eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa, but as for me and grandpa we believe. She'd been drinking too much eggnog, and we begged her not to go, but she forgot her medication and she staggered out the door into the snow. When we found her Christmas morning, at the scene of the attack, she had hoof-prints on her forehead and incriminating Claus marks on her back. Grandma got run over by a reindeer, walking home from our house Christmas eve. You can say there's no such thing as Santa, but as for me and grandpa we believe. Now we're all so proud of grandpa, he's been taking this so well. See him in there watching football, drinking beer and playing cards with cousin Mel. It's not Christmas without Grandma, all the family's dressed in black and we just can't help but wonder, should we open up her gifts, or send them back.
